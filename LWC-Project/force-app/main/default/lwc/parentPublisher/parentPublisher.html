<!--In this model we will have a pubsub.js that has ready events to help commutation between unrelated components
Pubsub model helps communication between components that are NOT in the same DOM
Component 1 : pubComp -> We fire the events from publisher component
In js file we import 2 library
import {CurrentPageReference} from 'lightning/navigation'
import { fireEvent } from â€˜c/pubsub';
Component 2 : subComp -> We handle events in the subscriber component
We will add pubsub.js file with reusable methods that is shared in the LWC folder that will be used by both component
